Mark," (leaning back in his chair, studying Sarah intently) Sarah, I know this isn't easy for you. But I believe your testimony will be crucial in Emily's defense."
Sarah," (nervously fidgeting with her hands) I know, Mark. I've been trying to prepare myself for this, but... I'm just not sure I can go through with it."
Mark," (leaning forward, placing a reassuring hand on her arm) Sarah, you're not alone in this. I'll be with you every step of the way. We'll go over every detail, and I'll help you navigate the courtroom."
Sarah," (looking up at Mark, her eyes filled with uncertainty) But what if I'm not telling the whole truth? What if there's something I've left out?"
Mark," (leaning back, considering her words carefully) Sarah, it's important that we're honest with each other. If there's something you've left out, now is the time to tell me. We can work through it together."
Sarah," (sighing deeply) Mark, I overheard Emily and Richard arguing about the divorce that very night. I didn't mean to pry, but I couldn't help but feel that something was off."
Mark," (nodding thoughtfully) Sarah, it's crucial that we present all the facts, even if they're not in our favor. We'll discuss how to handle this information in court. But I want you to know that I trust you, and I believe in your loyalty to the truth."
Sarah," (looking relieved) Thank you, Mark. I'll do my best to be honest and clear about what I've witnessed."
Mark," (smiling reassuringly) That's all I ask, Sarah. Together, we'll make sure that justice is served, and the truth is revealed."
Sarah," (smiling back, feeling a sense of relief) I'll be ready, Mark. I'll be ready for the stand."
