Mark," (leaning back in his chair, looking at Sarah intently) Sarah, I know this isn't an easy situation for you. But I believe in your loyalty to the Thorntons and your integrity. I also believe that the truth will come out, and we need to be prepared for that."
Sarah," (nervously fidgeting with her hands) Mark, I've thought about this a lot. I know what I saw and heard, but I'm not sure if it's enough to incriminate Emily. I don't want to betray a friend."
Mark," (leaning forward, placing his elbows on the desk) Sarah, it's important to remember that the truth isn't always straightforward. We need to consider all the facts, including the financial troubles in the Thornton marriage and the motives of other guests at the party. Your testimony, along with other pieces of evidence, could help paint a more complete picture."
Sarah," (sighs) I understand, Mark. But I can't help but feel conflicted. I want to do the right thing, but I don't want to hurt Emily."
Mark," (nods sympathetically) I understand your concerns, Sarah. But remember, the truth has a way of coming out. And if we can help guide it in the right direction, we may be able to protect Emily from any unintended consequences."
Sarah," (pauses, looking thoughtful) I'll do my best, Mark. I'll prepare for taking the stand and tell the truth as I know it."
Mark," (smiling reassuringly) That's all I can ask for, Sarah. And I'll be here to support you every step of the way."
Sarah," (smiling back, feeling a sense of relief) Thank you, Mark. I really appreciate your guidance and belief in me."
