Mark Turner," (sitting behind the desk, poring over files) Sarah, thank you for coming by today. I wanted to discuss some details regarding your testimony."
Sarah Reynolds," (entering the office, visibly anxious) Yes, Mark, I understand that this is a critical moment for us. I will do whatever it takes to help Emily."
Mark Turner," (looking up from the files, in a calming tone) I know that, Sarah, but it's also important that the truth come out. We cannot simply sweep anything under the rug. I need to understand exactly what you saw and heard during the party."
Sarah Reynolds," (hesitating) Well, I heard Emily and Richard arguing about the impending divorce. I also saw a few guests looking rather heated during the exchange, but I couldn't place who they were."
Mark Turner," Could you be more specific about who those guests were? Or even their general description? Every detail, however minor, might help us in the long run."
Sarah Reynolds," (nervously) I'm really not sure, Mark. It was dark, and the room was filled with echoes of conversations. But I did notice one guest, a man, wearing a red tie, leaving the room shortly after the argument."
Mark Turner," (writing down notes, pensive) Very well. Now, regarding your relationship with the Thorntons, do you have any insights as to their financial situation or reasons for the divorce?"
Sarah Reynolds," (shaking her head) I'm afraid I cannot divulge any specifics, Mark. I merely attended the party as a guest and did not possess any firsthand knowledge of their financial or marital issues. I can only reveal what I have observed."
Mark Turner," (examining her intently) Sarah, your honesty is greatly appreciated. Our primary goal is to protect Emily and the truth. If anything comes to mind or if new information arises, contact me immediately."
Sarah Reynolds," (nodding) I will do that, Mark. Thank you for your understanding and expectations."
Mark Turner," (standing up, offering her a reassuring smile) Trust me, Sarah. We will get through this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some other calls to make. Good luck, and we'll be in touch."
Sarah Reynolds," (gathering her belongings, taking a deep breath) Thank you, Mark. I believe in you and know we will overcome this ordeal."
Mark Turner," (waving her off with a firm handshake) Surely, Sarah. We will prevail."
