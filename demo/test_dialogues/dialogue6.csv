Mark Turner," Emily, I need to discuss the heated exchange between you and Richard during the party."
Emily Thorton," (folds her arms, slightly defensive) Mark, I'd rather focus on solving the issue at hand...the fact that my husband is dead."
Mark Turner," I understand that, Emily. However, it's crucial that we consider every possible angle in this investigation. I believe the heated exchange between you and Richard could be relevant to unraveling what happened that night."
Emily Thorton," (sighs) I've told you the truth about our rocky marriage, Mark. Our financial struggles and Richard's infidelity took a toll on us. That night, we argued about the potential divorce and his business dealings. I can't deny that things heated up between us, but I didn't harm him."
Mark Turner," I believe you, Emily. But I need to know all the details regarding that night. When were you last in contact with Richard before the incident? What did you both say to each other? Did you leave the room at any point?"
Emily Thorton," (pauses, looking down) Mark, I left the room after the argument to go to the restroom. I returned five minutes later and found him lying on the floor. I tried to revive him but to no avail. I didn't see or hear anything from anyone else in that room."
Mark Turner," (leaning back in his chair) Emily, you're the key witness and only remaining suspect in this case. It's important we explore every possible scenario. I appreciate your honesty and will work diligently to clear your name."
Emily Thorton," (gives a small smile) Thank you, Mark. I trust you'll do whatever it takes to prove my innocence."
Mark Turner," (nods, confidently) You can trust me on that."
