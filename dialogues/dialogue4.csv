Mark," (leaning back in his chair, studying Sarah intently) Sarah, I know this isn't easy for you. But I believe your testimony will be crucial in clearing Emily's name."
Sarah," (nervously fidgeting with her hands) I know, Mark. I've been trying to prepare myself for this, but... I'm just not sure I can go through with it."
Mark," (leaning forward, placing a reassuring hand on her arm) Sarah, you're not alone in this. I'll be here with you every step of the way. We'll go over every detail, and I'll help you navigate the courtroom."
Sarah," (looking up at Mark, her eyes filled with uncertainty) But what if I'm not telling the whole truth? What if there's something I've left out?"
Mark," (leaning back, considering her words) Sarah, it's important that we're honest with each other. If there's something you've left out, now is the time to tell me. We can work through it together."
Sarah," (sighing deeply) Mark, I heard Emily and Richard arguing that night. They were discussing his plans to file for divorce."
Mark, (nodding thoughtfully) And?
Sarah," (hesitant) I don't know if it's relevant, but... Richard had been dealing with some financial difficulties. I overheard Emily expressing frustration about it."
Mark," (leaning forward, taking notes) Sarah, every detail matters. We'll explore this further. But remember, the truth will set us free. Now, let's discuss your testimony in detail. What did you see and hear that night?"
Sarah," (taking a deep breath) I saw Emily and Richard arguing in the living room. Richard was pacing back and forth, and Emily was sitting on the couch, visibly upset. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but I heard Emily mention something about a divorce."
Mark," (nodding) Good. Now, let's go over the sequence of events leading up to that moment. What were you doing before you heard the argument?"
Sarah," (pausing to think) I was mingling with the other guests, making small talk. I remember seeing a few people who had their own reasons to dislike Richard."
Mark," (leaning forward, taking notes) Excellent. We'll explore those relationships further. Now, let's discuss your demeanor on the stand. How do you want to come across to the jury?"
Sarah," (looking at Mark with determination) I want to come across as truthful and loyal. I value the truth, and I'm here to help clear Emily's name."
Mark," (smiling) That's the spirit. Now, let's go over the logistics of testifying. Where will you wait before entering the courtroom?"
Sarah," (thinking) I'll wait in the witness room, if that's where other witnesses have waited."
Mark," (nodding) Excellent. We'll discuss the layout of the courtroom and the process of testifying in detail. But for now, let's focus on your testimony. What did you see and hear after the argument?"
Sarah," (pausing to remember) After the argument, I saw Richard leave the room. He went to the kitchen, and I heard a glass shatter. I didn't see who or what caused it, but I heard Emily call out his name."
Mark," (leaning forward, taking notes) Sarah, every detail matters. We'll explore this further. But for now, let's focus on your testimony. What did you do after the argument?"
Sarah," (thinking) I went to the bathroom to compose myself. When I returned, I saw Emily sitting on the couch, looking distraught. I offered her a glass of water and stayed with her until her husband returned."
Mark," (leaning forward, taking notes) Excellent. We'll explore your interactions with Emily further. But for now, let's focus on your demeanor on the stand. How do you want to come across to the jury?"
Sarah," (looking at Mark with determination) I want to come across as truthful and loyal. I value the truth, and I'm here to help clear Emily's name."
